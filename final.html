      I honestly can’t believe how lucky I am to have you! These past four months have been the happiest ever, and I swear, being with you is the best kind of adventure I could ask for. 💙✨
      
      You’re not just a good person—you’re the best boyfriend in the entire universe (yes, I did the research 😉). I love how effortlessly silly, weird, and totally ourselves we can be together. Life feels like a perfect little fairytale since you walked into it (except with more inside jokes and playful arguments where I always win 😌).
      
      From our tiny fights to our never-ending calls, I cherish every moment with you. Thank you for making me feel this special, for making my heart smile every single day, and for being my favorite person. I love you, MY VALENTINE! ❤️🥰
